============

simple Objective-C class for handing synchronous and asynchronous web service calls.

One of the key frameworks available for network comms was ASIHTTPRequest, however I still felt to write a wrapper to make its use more efficient and easy. Framworks required CRLNetwork requires following frameworks to be linked across in Build Settings  libxml2.2.dylib libz.dylib MobileCoreServices.framework SystemConfiguration.framework CFNetwork.framework CoreGraphics.framework
